Your task is to generate or improve the metadata fields for a Table.

Use the following input parameters:
    - Table name: {label}
    - Current table description: {description}
    - Current tags for table: {tags}
    - Column names: {columns}
    - Column Descriptions: {column_descriptions}
    - Sample data: {sample_data}

There are 4 metadata fields that can be requested to you.
    1. label - 1 to 3 words that give a "title" to the Table. If provided, you can use the current Table name as starting point.
    2. description - less than 30 words that summarize the content of the table. If provided, take the current Table description as starting point but mainly use the sample data (if provided), and then the column names and descriptions to generate the table description.
    3. tags - list of strings (less than 3), where each string can take any value. Tags should highlight the most important field or thematic of the Table. If there are current tags that represent additional information, add them to the list of tags.
    4. topics -  list of strings (1 or 2), where each string must be one of the following topics that represent company departments ['Finance', 'Marketing', 'Engineering', 'HR', 'Operations', 'Sales', 'Other'] Choose a topic according to the Table description.


There are some rules that you MUST follow:
- If any of the input parameters is equal to "No description provided" or is None or [] do not use that particular input
for generating the metadata fields.
- This time the user has requested ONLY the following metadata fields: {metadata_types} Your response should strictly
contain only the requested metadata fields.
- Evaluate if the given parameters are sufficient for generating the requested metadata, if not, respond with
"NotEnoughData" for all values of dictionary keys.
- Return the result as a Python dictionary where the keys are the requested metadata fields, all the keys must be
lowercase and the values are the corresponding generated metadata.

Here are some examples:

Example 1.

Given the following input parameters:
    Table name: my-table-1
    Current table description: Demo data
    Current tags for table: ["demo"]
    Column names: []
    Column Descriptions: []
    Sample data: None
    metadata_types: ["label", "description", "topics"]


response = {
    "label": "NotEnoughData",
    "description": "NotEnoughData",
    "topics": "NotEnoughData"
}

Example 2.
Given the following input parameters:
    Table name: my-table-2
    Current table description: Demo table with some sample data.
    Current tags for table: ['demo']
    Column names: ['author', 'year', 'avg_rating', 'pages', 'genre', 'count']
    Column Descriptions: ['Author that wrote the book', 'Year of publication', 'Average rating in Amazon.com', 'pages', 'genre', 'books sold in Amazon.com']
    Sample data: None
    metadata_types: ["label", description", "tags"]

response = {
    "label": "books_sales_with_ratings",
    "description": "This table is used for demo purposes and it contains book-related information including authorship, publication details, and performance metrics. It tracks books with their authors, publication years, and reader feedback through Amazon.com ratings."
    "tags": ["demo", "sales"]
}
