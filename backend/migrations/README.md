# Managing DB with Alembic locally

When we run ```docker-compose up``` the postgres container is created with no tables or schemas.

Upon start of GraphQL container, sqlalchemy ```declarative_base``` is used to create all tables with this function: 
```Base.metadata.create_all(engine.engine)```. **The number of tables depends on the modules that are enabled in ```config.json``` (in the root of the project).**

As the database is created from scratch, it has no current information about migration state, so, first we need to run database upgrade.
After that alembic will be able to generate the further migrations localy.

To upgrade database without generating migrations use
```bash
make upgrade-db 
```
or
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=backend
export envname=local
alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
```
This command will apply all migrations, and syncronize the DB state with local list of migraitions.

To upgrade database and generate alembic migration during development use:

```bash
make generate-migrations
```
or
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=backend
export envname=local
alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
alembic -c backend/alembic.ini revision -m "_describe_changes_shortly" --autogenerate
```
Please, change the auto-generated filename postfix with the short description of the migration purpose.

## What to know about autogenerated migrations:

**Autogenerate will detect:**

 - Table additions, removals. 
 - Column additions, removals.
 - Change of nullable status on columns.
 - Basic changes in indexes and explicitly-named unique constraints
 - Basic changes in foreign key constraints

**Autogenerate can optionally detect:**

 - Change of column type. This will occur by default unless the parameter `EnvironmentContext.configure.compare_type` is set to `False`. The default implementation will reliably detect major changes, such as between `Numeric` and `String`, as well as accommodate for the types generated by SQLAlchemy’s “generic” types such as `Boolean`. Arguments that are shared between both types, such as length and precision values, will also be compared. If either the metadata type or database type has additional arguments beyond that of the other type, these are not compared, such as if one numeric type featured a “scale” and other type did not, this would be seen as the backing database not supporting the value, or reporting on a default that the metadata did not specify.

The type comparison logic is fully extensible as well; see [Comparing Types](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/autogenerate.html#compare-types) for details.

 - Change of server default. This will occur if you set the `EnvironmentContext.configure.compare_server_default` parameter to `True`, or to a custom callable function. This feature works well for simple cases but cannot always produce accurate results. The Postgresql backend will actually invoke the “detected” and “metadata” values against the database to determine equivalence. The feature is off by default so that it can be tested on the target schema first. Like type comparison, it can also be customized by passing a callable; see the function’s documentation for details.

**Autogenerate can not detect:**

- Changes of table name. These will come out as an add/drop of two different tables, and should be hand-edited into a name change instead.
  In this case you should remove the automatically generated scripts and replace them with the following code (e.g. renaming table 'marathon' to 'snickers):
  ```python
    def upgrade():
        op.rename_table('marathon', 'snickers')
        op.execute('ALTER SEQUENCE marathon_id_seq RENAME TO snickers_id_seq') # don't forget to rename all related entities
        op.execute('ALTER INDEX marathon_pkey RENAME TO snickers_pkey')
    
    def downgrade():
        op.rename_table('snickers', 'marathon')
        op.execute('ALTER SEQUENCE snickers_id_seq RENAME TO marathon_id_seq')
        op.execute('ALTER INDEX snickers_pkey RENAME TO marathon_pkey')
  ```
- Changes of column name. Like table name changes, these are detected as a column add/drop pair, which is not at all the same as a name change. 
  To keep all data in the column add this script to upgrade function (and don't forget to add inverse in downgrade function)
  ```python
  with op.batch_alter_table('my_table', schema=None) as batch_op: batch_op.alter_column('old_col_name', new_column_name='new_col_name')
  ```
- Anonymously named constraints. Give your constraints a name, e.g. `UniqueConstraint('col1', 'col2', name="my_name")`. See the section The [Importance of Naming Constraints ](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/naming.html)for background on how to configure automatic naming schemes for constraints. 
- Special SQLAlchemy types such as Enum when generated on a backend which doesn’t support ENUM directly - this because the representation of such a type in the non-supporting database, i.e. a CHAR+ CHECK constraint, could be any kind of CHAR+CHECK. For SQLAlchemy to determine that this is actually an ENUM would only be a guess, something that’s generally a bad idea. To implement your own “guessing” function here, use the `sqlalchemy.events.DDLEvents.column_reflect()` event to detect when a CHAR (or whatever the target type is) is reflected, and change it to an ENUM (or whatever type is desired) if it is known that that’s the intent of the type. `The sqlalchemy.events.DDLEvents.after_parent_attach()` can be used within the autogenerate process to intercept and un-attach unwanted CHECK constraints. 
  As example of handling Enums, please refer to  `ConfidentialityClassification` in migration `97050ec09354_release_3_7_8.py`


**Autogenerate can’t currently, but will eventually detect:**
- Some free-standing constraint additions and removals may not be supported, including PRIMARY KEY, EXCLUDE, CHECK; these are not necessarily implemented within the autogenerate detection system and also may not be supported by the supporting SQLAlchemy dialect. 
- Sequence additions, removals - not yet implemented.
